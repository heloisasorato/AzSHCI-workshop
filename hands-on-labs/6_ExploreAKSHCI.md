HOL-4: Exercise 3: Explore the AKS on Azure Stack HCI environment
==============
Overview
-----------
With all key components deployed, including the management cluster, along with target clusters, you can now begin to explore some of the additional capabilities within AKS on Azure Stack HCI. We'll list a few recommended activities below, to expose you to some of the key elements, but for the rest, we'll [direct you over to the official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/aks-hci/ "AKS on Azure Stack HCI documentation").

Task 1: Deploying a simple Linux application
-----------
With your cluster up and running, to illustrate how easy it is to deploy a containerized application, The following steps will highlight key areas of deployment, testing, and scaling an application.

During the deployment of AKS on Azure Stack HCI, **kubectl** was configured on your Azure VM Host. Kubectl provides several ways to manage your Kubernetes clusters and applications.

As part of this brief tutorial, you'll deploy an [Azure vote application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-voting-app-redis "Azure vote application on GitHub"). In order to deploy the application, you'll need a Kubernetes manifest file. A Kubernetes manifest file defines the desired state for the cluster, such as what container images to run. The manifest we'll use in this tutorial includes two Kubernetes deployments - one for the sample Azure Vote Python application, and the other for a Redis instance. Two Kubernetes services are also created - an internal service for the Redis instance, and external service to access the Azure Vote application from the internet.

1. First, run the following command from an **administrative PowerShell command** to list your Kubernetes nodes

   ```powershell
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

   ![Output of kubectl get nodes](./media/getnodes.png "Output of kubectl get nodes")

2. Next, from the same **PowerShell **console**** run the following command to deploy the application directly from GitHub:

    ```powershell
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/aks-hci/main/eval/yaml/azure-vote.yaml
    ```

    ![Output of kubectl apply](./media/output1.png "Output of kubectl apply")

3. Next, run the following command to monitor the progress of the deployment (using the --watch argument):

    ```powershell
    kubectl get service azure-vote-front --watch
    ```

During deployment, you may see the **External-IP** showing as *Pending* - when this changes to an IP address, you can use **CTRL + C** to stop the watch process. The stopping process can take a few seconds to stop the script from running state.
    
    
   >Note: If the watch process take too long to terminate the operation, close the PowerShell window. Click on the windows button and look for PowerShell ISE and right-click on it to Run as administrator to open new PowerShell window.
   
   
   ![Output of kubectl get service](./media/IP.png "Output of kubectl get service")

    In our case, you can see that the service has been allocated the **192.168.0.152** IP address. Copy the IP Address to use in the next step.

4. At this point, open **Microsoft Edge** and navigate to the IP address that you have copied from the previous step.

6. We have created a single replica of the Azure Vote front end and Redis instance. To see the number and state of pods in your cluster, use the **kubectl get command** as follows. The output should show one front end pod and one back-end pod:

    ```powershell
    kubectl get pods -n default
    ```

   ![Output of kubectl get pods](./media/nodes1.png "Output of kubectl get pods")

7. To change the number of pods in the azure-vote-front deployment, use the **kubectl scale command**. The following example **increases the number of front end pods to 5**

    ```powershell
    kubectl scale --replicas=5 deployment/azure-vote-front
    ```

     ![Output of kubectl scale](./media/kubectl_scale.png "Output of kubectl scale")

8. Run **kubectl get pods** again to verify that additional pods have been created. After a minute or so, the additional pods are available in your cluster

    ```powershell
    kubectl get pods -n default
    ```

    ![Output of kubectl get pods](./media/kubectl_get_pods_scaled.png "Output of kubectl get pods")

You should now have 5 pods for this application.

If you want to continue your learning on AKS-HCI, and are interested in deploying Windows applications in AKS on Azure Stack HCI, [you can check out these resources on the official docs page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/aks-hci/deploy-windows-application "Deploy Windows applications in Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI").

Task 2: Expose a nested application to the internet
-----------
If you've followed all the steps in this guide, you'll have a running AKS-HCI infrastructure, including a target cluster that can run your containerized workloads. Additionally, if you've deployed the simple Linux application using the [tutorial above](#deploying-a-simple-linux-application), you'll now have an Azure Voting web application running in a container on your AKS-HCI infrastructure. This application will likely have been allocated an IP address from your internal NAT network, **192.168.0.0/16**, and opening your Edge browser within the Azure VM allows you to access that web application using its 192.168.0.x IP address and optionally, its port number.

However, the Azure Voting web app, and any other apps on the 192.168.0.0/16 internal network inside your Azure VM, cannot be reached from outside of the Azure VM, unless you perform some additional configuration.
  **NOTE** - This is specific to the Azure VM nested configuration, and would not be required in a production deployment on-premises.

In a real scenario, using hardware you'd have to expose this service externally. Since we're using nested virtualization, please run this script that adds a NSG rule in the Host VM and applies NAT static mapping.

1. Open powershell Console from the Start Menu.

2. Run the below command to run the powershell script that is already created and download inside the VM. 

      ```powershell
      cd V:\ClusterStorage
      .\nested-application.ps1
      
      ```    
       
3. You will get a popup to login to your azure account, you can get your azure credentials from the environments details tab.
    
    ![Output of kubectl get pods](./media/ex5.1.png "Output of kubectl get pods")  
      
3. Once the script execution is completed, you will see the output same as below.

    ![Output of kubectl get pods](./media/ex5.2.png "Output of kubectl get pods")
     
4. Now copy the public ip and browse it outside of the VM in any browser and see how the app is working.

Congratulations!

You've reached the end of this exercise. You can now proceed with the next exercise.
